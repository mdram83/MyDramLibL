MyDramLibL is remake of MyDramLibrary that is now based on Laravel.
As it is much easier and help me in learning the framework will continue project with Laravel.

TODO:
- Then same for Music Album (and then try to minimize repeated code)
- All saves - camel case user inputs (Guilds, Tags, Artist, Publishers)

- Move models (Books etc.) to dedicated namespaces
- Cleanup view templates and components (incl. directory structure and js. files)
- Nicer confirm window for Delete (not raw browser "confirm")
- Home screens for guest and auth (and MVP is ready to deploy...)
- Then functionalities (groups/friends, filtering, buying recommendations etc.)
