MyDramLibL is remake of MyDramLibrary that is now based on Laravel.
As it is much easier and help me in learning the framework will continue project with Laravel.
Though there is a debt (in learning and SOLID) using Laravel, e.g. helper functions and eloquent with magic methods.

MVP
- Check registration/emailing/password reset on server with email working
- Check process of email confirmation and what you can and can not do without it
- How to publish JS scripts (nmp run build?...)
- Consider rate limit (by ip/email?) on register/login
- How to optimize production code (check laravel documentation)

Later:
- Dashboard screen or other main page for logged user
- Not Laravel default styling
- Nicer confirm window for Delete (not raw browser "confirm")
- Consider more attributes for Music Album (Supporting Bands, Supporting Artists)
- Consider Form Request instance for itemable (with Book, Music Album child classes)
- Check sth like require_once on blade side to add artists and guilds datalist only once - @pushOnce
- Considering adding movies, games and boardgames and music scores (for family)
- Then functionalities (groups/friends, more itemable types filtering, buying recommendations etc.)
