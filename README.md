MyDramLibL is remake of MyDramLibrary that is now based on Laravel.
As it is much easier and help me in learning the framework will continue project with Laravel.
Though there is a debt (in learning and SOLID) using Laravel, e.g. helper functions and eloquent with magic methods.

MVP
- Inform user that Publisher, Tags, Artists and Guilds are public (and what is visible to whom)
- Inform user that username should not hold personal data
- Check registration/emailing/password reset on server with email working
- Check process of email confirmation and what you can and can not do without it
- How to handle cookies and inform user about it
- How to publish JS scripts (nmp...)
- How to optimize production code (check laravel documentation)

Later:
- Dashboard screen or other main page for logged user
- Not Laravel default styling
- Nicer confirm window for Delete (not raw browser "confirm")
- Consider more attributes for Music Album (Supporting Bands, Supporting Artists)
- Check sth like require_once on blade side to add artists and guilds datalist only once
- Considering adding movies, games and boardgames and music scores (for family)
- Then functionalities (groups/friends, more itemable types filtering, buying recommendations etc.)
