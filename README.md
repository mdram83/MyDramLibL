MyDramLibL is remake of MyDramLibrary that is now based on Laravel.
As it is much easier and help me in learning the framework will continue project with Laravel.

TODO:
- EAN details for Music Albums through some API
- All saves - camel case user inputs (Guilds, Tags, Artist, Publishers)

- Move models (Books, Artists, etc.) to dedicated namespaces
- Nicer confirm window for Delete (not raw browser "confirm")
- Home screens for guest and auth (and MVP is ready to deploy...)
- Then functionalities (groups/friends, more itemable types filtering, buying recommendations etc.)
