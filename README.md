MyDramLibL is remake of MyDramLibrary that is now based on Laravel.
As it is much easier and help me in learning the framework will continue project with Laravel.

TODO:
1. Author on Book create form
+ Form layout and div for added authors
+ Button to add
+ Functions to add to div/form and remove
- List of existing authors from Ajax
- functions to select specific (with first and last name) from existing data list
- Mapping authors from API (adjust js functions then)
- refactor JS functions not to repeat code (e.g. span and 'a' elements creation)
