MyDramLibL is remake of MyDramLibrary that is now based on Laravel.
As it is much easier and help me in learning the framework will continue project with Laravel.

TODO:
- Nicer confirm window for Delete (not raw browser "confirm")

- Then same for Music Album (and then try to minimize repeated code)

- Move models (Books etc.) to dedicated namespaces
- Cleanup view templates and components (incl. directory structure and js. files)
- Consider repository/factory (e.g. Store Book)
- Consider Form Requests (special class for Request, need to check)
- Home screens for guest and auth
- More functionalities (groups/friends, filtering, buying recommendations etc.)
