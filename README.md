MyDramLibL is remake of MyDramLibrary that is now based on Laravel.
As it is much easier and help me in learning the framework will continue project with Laravel.

TODO:
- Edit and Update Book (similar to add, not really more) : 
* Removing thumbnail (if wrong was added)... - CONSIDER THUMBNAIL (URL) AS NORMAL INPUT
* Consier disabling special chars (but still alow e.g. Â©) in Tags and Artists


- Delete Book (item and itemable separately, rest is covered by db relations)
- Then same for Music Album (and then try to minimize repeated code)



- More Add buttons (on Add from, Show, Edit?)
- Move models (Books etc.) to dedicated namespaces
- Cleanup view templates and components (incl. directory structure and js. files)
- Consider repository/factory (e.g. Store Book)
- Consider Form Requests (special class for Request, need to check)
- Home screens for guest and auth
- More functionalities (groups/friends, filtering, buying recommendations etc.)
